## [3.1.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- **Skill-friction reporting via a new `after_implement` hook.** A fourth hook command (`speckit.infrahub-speckit.route-friction`) fires when `/speckit.implement` finishes and checks the completed cycle for evidence that an Infrahub skill's own guidance had a gap. On a hit it prints a one-line offer naming the implicated skill and the evidence. Replying routes into the `infrahub-reporting-skill-gaps` skill, which drafts a redacted report and hands it to `infrahub-reporting-issues` for filing.

  Infrahub skills fail quietly: a missing or unclear rule does not crash a run, it produces extra round trips and repeated nudges until the model works the answer out anyway. That friction is invisible once the cycle ends, so the hook looks for it while the session still holds the evidence.

- **Detection is automatic; drafting and filing are not.** The hook does a cheap in-session scan and never invokes the reporting skill itself, so a cycle with nothing to report costs one line. The offer it prints is the trigger `infrahub-reporting-skill-gaps` already declares, so no extra wiring is needed to route a user's reply. Filing then passes through that skill's ban on filing directly, plus the mandatory content-review and submission-method gates in `infrahub-reporting-issues`. Nothing reaches GitHub without explicit approval, and the manual submission path sends nothing from the user's machine.

- **An evidence gate that excludes session-shape counters.** The gate opens only on a closing probe from the skill's detection ladder: a red-to-green transition on the same target (`infrahubctl schema load` / `object load` / `check run` / `transform run`, or `pytest`), a coverage read showing no rule file covers the topic, or an in-session correction to an agent-authored artifact. Retry counts, edit churn, repeated asks, and docs escapes do not qualify. They rise for reasons unrelated to a skill's guidance, and a hook that fired on them would offer a report on most cycles and train users to ignore it.

- **Two per-project escape hatches**, both on the hook's entry in `.specify/extensions.yml`: `optional: true` converts it from automatic to an opt-in offer (a `prompt` ships in the entry ready for this), and `enabled: false` disables it.

### Changed

- The `after_implement` friction hook does **not** halt when its reporting skills are absent, unlike the three `before_*` hooks, which halt when the mandatory `infrahub-managing-*` skills are missing. It runs after implementation has already succeeded, so nothing it discovers may fail, retry, or roll back a finished run. Every path through it returns; a missing skill, an error, or an ambiguous read all degrade to a no-op line.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: This package is now a spec-kit **extension** (`extension.yml`), not a preset (`preset.yml`). Composition has moved from the slash-command layer (preset/wrap) to the skill-runtime layer (hooks). Install with `specify extension add` instead of `specify preset add`. The extension id is `infrahub-speckit` (renamed from `infrahub` to avoid collision with the standalone `infrahub` JPD/Jira branch validator extension).
- **BREAKING**: The three customized commands (`speckit.specify`, `speckit.plan`, `speckit.implement`) are no longer wrapped. The Infrahub routing logic now lives in three new hook commands (`speckit.infrahub-speckit.route-specify`, `route-plan`, `route-implement`) registered against `before_specify`, `before_plan`, and `before_implement` respectively. From a user's perspective, `/speckit.specify` behaves the same — the hook fires before the core skill body runs. From an integrator's perspective, the routing now fires for *any* invocation of the underlying skills, not just the slash command — so callers like `opsmill-speckit/auto` are now covered.

### Why this matters

The v2.x preset wrapped slash command files. When `opsmill-speckit/auto` (or any other skill or agent) invoked the `speckit-specify` skill directly without going through `/speckit.specify`, the wrap was bypassed and Infrahub routing did not run. The v3.0 hook fires inside the core skill's pre-execution checks, regardless of caller.

### Migration

```bash
specify preset remove infrahub
specify extension add infrahub-speckit --from https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-speckit/archive/refs/tags/v3.0.0.zip
```

After upgrade, `.specify/extensions.yml` will have three new entries under `hooks.before_specify`, `hooks.before_plan`, and `hooks.before_implement`. No other consumer-side changes required.

### Removed

- `preset.yml` (replaced by `extension.yml`).
- `commands/speckit.specify.md`, `commands/speckit.plan.md`, `commands/speckit.implement.md` (replaced by the three `route-*` hook commands).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Preflight skill-availability check in all three wrapped commands. If `.infrahub.yml` is present and any `infrahub:*` skill from the `opsmill/infrahub` package is missing, the command halts with install guidance (`npx skills add opsmill/infrahub-skills` or the Claude Code plugin marketplace equivalent) and a pointer to https://docs.infrahub.app/skills/installation-setup. Closes a silent-failure hole where the "MUST invoke skill" instruction no-op'd when the skills weren't installed.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Commands now use the `wrap` composition strategy introduced in spec-kit v0.8.0 instead of `replace`. The core command body (including `before_specify` / `after_plan` / `after_implement` hooks, `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` resolution, `.specify/feature.json` persistence, marker-based agent context updates, and language-specific `.gitignore` patterns) is inherited automatically from upstream.
- Minimum required `speckit_version` bumped from `>=0.4.1` to `>=0.8.0`.
- `speckit.specify.md`, `speckit.plan.md`, and `speckit.implement.md` now contain only the Infrahub-specific pre-logic (routing, preflight, skill invocation, template selection) followed by the `{CORE_TEMPLATE}` placeholder.
- README now distinguishes the REQUIRED `opsmill/infrahub` Claude Code skills package from the OPTIONAL `infrahub` spec-kit extension, with install commands for both.

### Removed

- `requires.extensions` entry in `preset.yml` — not part of the official spec-kit preset schema. The `infrahub` extension dependency is now documented in README instead.
- `replaces:` fields on template entries in `preset.yml` — superseded by `strategy: "wrap"`, which identifies the wrapped command via the `name` field.
- Duplicated `before_specify` / `after_specify` / `before_plan` / `after_plan` / `before_implement` / `after_implement` hook-handling blocks — now inherited from core.
- Duplicated Outline, Phases, and Quick Guidelines sections — now inherited from core.
